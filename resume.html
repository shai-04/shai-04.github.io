                    <p>
                        I'm an aspiring software developer that has a strong affinity for the field of Information Technology. I
                        have completed my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Richfield and would like to pursue
                        a career whereby my skills and qualification in Information Technology can be fully realized and
                        harnessed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a passionate young leader, highly ambitious, dedicated, hardworking and driven by
                        motivation to complete the task at hand. I can easily learn new skills and apply it effectively towards a
                        problem. I enjoy taking on new challenges and discovering different ways to solve it. I'm continuously
                        learning new IT concepts and treat every opportunity as a way to improve my skills, and by proxy, myself
                        as a whole. I am currently seeking employment to support myself and gain valuable experience in the IT
                        sector.
