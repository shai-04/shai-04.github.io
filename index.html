                <h1>Gamified Resume</h1>
                <p>Reviewing a candidate's resume can easily become monotounous, especially if you're going through several at a time. To make it a bit less dull, I turned my resume into a mini platformer game. If you have some time on your hands, give it a shot and unwind!</p>
